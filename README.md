Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that helps people with money. They have hired Global Rain, and me too, to make a new website to help their business work better. Artemis Financial helps people save money, plan for retirement, invest, and get insurance. Global Rain has been asked to make an app for people to put files on and get into their accounts. They are most worried about making sure the data is transferred correctly.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?

One of the good things about this project was creating codes to check data using different security methods to make sure it's accurate. It is very important to code in a secure way, even if the application is small. Keeping the customers' data and the company's data safe is crucial, especially with the increasing digital attacks. We need to think about security at every stage of making the software.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I had a hard time reading and understanding the vulnerability report created by using Maven dependency checks. There was a lot of information to understand, most of which I did not know before starting this course. I believe it's really important to check for dependencies, especially for apps that use frameworks and external APIs to get and work with data.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I added extra security to the app by using different ways to lock up the information. Various parts of the app need different ways to stay safe, depending on what's being done. For instance, some sets of steps are better for checking the information in a file, while some are more focused on verifying a user's login details. I am interested in using a more complicated way to keep things safe in my future work.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I checked how each part of the website works before making sure everything works together with other resources. After I changed the code, I did more checks to make sure I didn't make any new mistakes.

what resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

We used a lot of information from the Spring framework documents and tutorials on making and reading reports about security weaknesses to help us create this project. Reading the instructions for a tool or programming language can be useful, especially if you don't know how to use it yet.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I want to show the reports about vulnerabilities, or the information and explanations I made from the reports. I think it's important for web developers to understand security reports. This will be helpful for getting a job in the future. Although I'm not sure if I can understand these reports well, I think this project is helping me learn and improve.
